@section sec_intro   Introduction
                     This portfolio containt the totality of our work for Lab 2 in Me 405.
                     This includes our closed loop controller and serial communication files.
                     Our controller consisted of a simple proportional controller.

                     ##KP = 0.9
                     ![](KP_09.png)
                     ##KP = 0.835
                     ![](KP_0835.png)
                     ##KP = 0.8
                     ![](KP_08.png)
                     
                     From these test we concluded that a Kp value of 0.835 provided the best results
                     since the final position was roughly 90 ticks off of the correct value
